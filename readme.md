## Features

### File Operations
- `ls` - List files in current directory with color-coded types
- `ls -l` - Detailed file listing with permissions, size, and timestamps
- `pwd` - Print working directory
- `cd <directory>` - Change directory
- `touch <file>` - Create a new file or update timestamp
- `rm <file>` - Remove a file
- `cat <file>` - Display file contents with formatting

### Directory Operations
- `mkdir <directory>` - Create a directory
- `mkdir -p <directory>` - Create a directory and its parents
- `rmdir <directory>` - Remove an empty directory
- `rmdir -r <directory>` - Remove a directory and its contents

### File Management
- `cp <source> <dest>` - Copy a file
- `cp -r <source> <dest>` - Copy directory recursively
- `mv <source> <dest>` - Move/rename files or directories
- `stat <file/dir>` - Display detailed file or directory information
- `ln <target> <link_name>` - Create symbolic link

### Search and Information
- `find <dir> <pattern>` - Find files matching pattern
- `grep <file> <pattern>` - Search for pattern in file
- `echo <text>` - Print text to the terminal
- `exit` - Exit the shell
- `help` - Display help message with all available commands

## User Experience
- Colorful welcome banner with ASCII art
- Git branch detection in prompt
- Color-coded file listings by type
- Human-readable file sizes
